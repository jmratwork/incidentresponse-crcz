# Enablement artefacts for CyberRangeCZ

This directory no longer contains provisioning playbooks. Instead, it hosts reference artefacts that enable the Random Education Platform (REP) and the NG-SOC/NG-SIEM/NG-SOAR/CICMS Operator/CTI-SS/Playbook Library services described in Subcase 1d.

- `subcase-1d-services.md` documents how to activate and connect each component.
- `cacao-playbook-automation.md` sets out the automated procedures for managing the CACAO playbook lifecycle within NG-SOAR and its integration with CICMS Operator, CTI-SS and the playbook library.

Each artefact focuses exclusively on the capabilities shown in the subcase diagram and omits dependencies on external tooling unrelated to the NG ecosystem.
